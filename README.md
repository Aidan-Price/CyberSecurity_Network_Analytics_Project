# CyberSecurity_Network_Analytics_Project
Project for Cyber Security Network Analytics.

The primary code is 'code/main.py'. 

Run with 'python main.py <file path to txt or csv> <model type>'

The txt or csv file should be the feature files created from Assignment 1 or the MTA-KDD-19 data files at the repository linked in the code. Model types are either NN (neural network), CNN (convolutional neural network), or LSTM (long short term memory).

Run the test with 'python test.py'.
